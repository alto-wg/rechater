Operation Automation for ALTO
=============================

## Proposed paragraph

Documentation of best practices and extension of ALTO for facilitating
operational automation tasks. Although the working group has proposed a best
practice document (i.e., RFC7971) about deployment considerations, newer ALTO
protocol extensions (e.g., the incremental update mechanism, cost calendar,
unified properties, and path vector) and newer use cases (e.g., ZSM
closed-loop automation, mobile edge computing) require additional
considerations. Those include, e.g., decisions on information resources
exposed in the information resource directory (IRD), notification of changes
either in proactive or reactive mode, or aggregation/processing of the
collected information according to the clientsâ€™ requests, for mentioning just
a few. Furthermore, newer ALTO services may require more interaction with
applications to better predict/decide which low-level information should be
collected/measured, and which aggregated information should be precomputed.
The working group will (1) investigate the best practices in ALTO operations
automation, including the support of newer ALTO protocol extensions and use
cases; (2) propose new protocol extensions to allow applications to better
express needs about interested flows and related resources.

## Basic Issue

- Complexity of operations on new extensions and new use cases
  - Practical operations of an ALTO server includes the complex workflow
  - New ALTO protocol extensions (e.g., the incremental update mechanism,
    cost calendar, unified properties, and path vector) require new
    architectural and deployment considerations
  - New use cases (e.g., ZSM closed-loop automation, mobile edge computing)
    require new operation integrations with different systems
- Reactive measurement and computation
  - ALTO information resource may be populated reactively, which requests
    more communications with applications to predict/decide which low-level
    information (e.g., INT) should be collected/measured, and which intermediate
    information (e.g., end-to-end path cache) should be precomputed

## Potential solution(s)

- Investigate best practices (extending RFC7971) including:
  - Automatic IRD generation
  - ALTO information resources population from information collected by existing routing
    systems and measurement tools (e.g., TEDB, LSPDB, SNMP)
  - Reactive ALTO information resources update
  - Aggregation of different information sources
  - Considerations about intermediate abstraction (e.g., history, path cache)
- Define a new interface (service) between the application and server to allow
  the application to subscribe demands and enable reactive measurement and
  computation:
  - Interested E2E flows
  - Constraints for flows
  - Interested (computing) resources

## Remaining issues to be addressed

- How to reactively populate on-demand ALTO information resources (e.g., path
  vectors) based on client queries
- Flows that applications are interested in may change because of dynamic
  network state
  - e.g., applications are only interested in the endpoints attached to the
    specific PoP (Point of Presence)
- Constraints for interested flows may be correlated
  - e.g., filter all sources whose total upload bandwidth are higher than the
    threshold
